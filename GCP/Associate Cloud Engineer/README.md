This GitHub repository aims to share my personal notes taken during my Associate Cloud Engineer exam preparation. These notes are the result of public bibliography available over the Internet and the Official Exam Preparation Course from GCP.

The main reason for doing this repository is to help others with the exam preparation as well as to clarify and understand all concepts explained over the course.
